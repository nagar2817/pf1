I always wanted to build something that can be useful for a community. The first community I am in from my birth is Muslim! What a great opportunity for me to build something that can bring me peace and satisfaction and also be useful for other people.
I wanted to create something that can provide your prayer time for any location. A lot of actors do the same today, but I wanted something that can be more like a hybrid app. Have it as a web app, website, desktop app, in the same way, that's good for me!
Nothing to bother the customer, no advertisement, just free service.
